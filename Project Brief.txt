Checkpoint 4

Programming theory in action


The goal is to create a small street situation, three lanes with randomly spawning cars. The cars move in one direction and may decide to stop in the middle.

1) Inheritance Pillar
Vehicle is a generic object. Other objects (Car, Bus, Sports Car, Broken Car, etc.) will derive from it.

2) Polymorphism Pillar
Vehicle has function Drive(). All objects can drive only one way (speed), Broken Car can be only pushed (force).

3) Encapsulation Pillar
Speed cannot be negative.

4) Abstraction Pillar
TurnOn(), TurnOff(), Drive(), Brake().
